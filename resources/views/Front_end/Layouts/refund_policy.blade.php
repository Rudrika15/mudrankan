                <h4 class="txt">Returns</h4>
                <p>You have [X] calendar days to return an item from the date you received it. To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the same condition that you received it. Your item must be in the original packaging and must include a receipt or proof of purchase.</p>

                <h4 class="txt">Refunds</h4>
                <p>Once we receive your item, we will inspect it and notify you that we have received your returned item. We will immediately notify you on the status of your refund after inspecting the item.</p>
                <p>If your return is approved, we will initiate a refund to your original method of payment. The credit will be applied within a certain amount of days, depending on your card issuer’s policies.</p>

                <h4 class="txt">Late or Missing Refunds</h4>
                <p>If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again. Then contact your credit card company; it may take some time before your refund is officially posted. Next, contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted. If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@yourstore.com">support@yourstore.com</a>.</p>

                <h4 class="txt">Sale Items</h4>
                <p>Only regular priced items may be refunded. Unfortunately, sale items cannot be refunded.</p>

                <h4 class="txt">Exchanges</h4>
                <p>We only replace items if they are defective or damaged. If you need to exchange it for the same item, send us an email at <a href="mailto:support@yourstore.com">support@yourstore.com</a> and send your item to: [Store Address].</p>

                <h4 class="txt">Shipping</h4>
                <p>You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund.</p>
